This Behat extension requires following extensions, check their documentations for installation & usage:
* [Symfony2Extension](https://github.com/Behat/Symfony2Extension)
* [Behatch](https://github.com/Behatch/contexts)
* [MinkExtension](https://github.com/Behat/MinkExtension)

**This extension is just a shortcut to write some steps, it doesn't replace your custom steps.** For instance, if you
want to test that updating a user updates its password, you still need to add a customer step like
`And the user password has been successfully updated`.

## Install

```bash
composer require --dev vincentchalamon/api-extension
```

Declare required extensions in your Behat configuration:
```yaml
# behat.yml.dist
default:
    # ...
    suites:
        default:
            contexts:
                - Behat\MinkExtension\Context\MinkContext
                - Behatch\Context\RestContext
                - Behatch\Context\JsonContext
                - ApiExtension\Context\ApiContext
                - ApiExtension\Context\FixturesContext
    extensions:
        Behat\Symfony2Extension:
            kernel:
                bootstrap: features/bootstrap/bootstrap.php
                class: App\Kernel
        Behat\MinkExtension:
            base_url: 'http://www.example.com/'
            sessions:
                default:
                    symfony2: ~
        Behatch\Extension: ~
        # ...
        ApiExtension: ~
```

### Using custom guessers for populator

```yaml
# behat.yml.dist
default:
    # ...
    extensions:
        # ...
        ApiExtension:
            guessers:
              - App\Populator\Guesser\AcustomGuesser
              - App\Populator\Guesser\AnotherCustomGuesser
```

## Usage with Symfony FrameworkBundle < 4.1

Running with Symfony FrameworkBundle < 4.1, you need to override some private services:

```yaml
# config/services_test.yaml

# Hack for Behat: allow to inject some private services
services:
    test.property_info:
        parent: property_info
        public: true
    test.api_platform.metadata.resource.metadata_factory.annotation:
        parent: api_platform.metadata.resource.metadata_factory.annotation
        public: true
    test.api_platform.iri_converter:
        parent: api_platform.iri_converter
        public: true
    test.annotation_reader:
        parent: annotation_reader
        public: true
    test.router:
        parent: router
        public: true
```

```yaml
# behat.yml.dist
default:
    # ...
    extensions:
        # ...
        ApiExtension:
            services:
                metadataFactory: '@test.api_platform.metadata.resource.metadata_factory.annotation'
                iriConverter: '@test.api_platform.iri_converter'
                registry: '@doctrine'
                propertyInfo: '@test.property_info'
                annotationReader: '@test.annotation_reader'
                router: '@test.router'
```

## Add faker provider

To use a [custom faker provider](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker#faker-internals-understanding-providers) from
[fzaninotto/Faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker), update your Behat configuration as following:

```yaml
# behat.yml.dist
default:
    # ...
    extensions:
        # ...
        ApiExtension:
            # ...
            providers:
                - App\Faker\Provider\MiscellaneousProvider
```
