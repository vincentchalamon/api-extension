First of all, thank you for contributing, you're awesome!

To have your code integrated in the project, there is some rules to follow, but don't panic, it's easy!

## Reporting bugs

If you happen to find a bug, we kindly request you to report it using GitHub by following these 3 points:

* Check if the bug is not already reported
* A clear title to resume the issue
* A description of the workflow needed to reproduce the bug (a Gherkin scenario would be awesome)

> _NOTE:_ Don't hesitate giving as much information as you can (OS, PHP version extensions...)

## Git

It is recommended to have a global `.gitignore` file as described in https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/.
Here is an example: https://gist.github.com/vincentchalamon/d5defad563ed49d9306a4aa57dfd4498

### Sign commits

**It is highly recommended to sign commits using GPG**: https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-using-gpg/

### Pull Requests

When you send a Pull Request, just make sure that:

* You add valid test cases (unit & functional)
* Tests are green
* You make the Pull Request on master
* You specify the status of your Pull Request: `WIP` (Work In Progress) or `RFR` (Ready For Review)
* Your code respect [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design))
* Your have a minimum 60% unit test coverage, full coverage welcome

### Matching coding standards

This project follows [Symfony coding standards](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html).
But don't worry, you can fix CS issues automatically using the [PHP CS Fixer](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/) tool already
installed in the project:

```bash
vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix src
```

And then, add fixed file to your commit before push. Be sure to add only **your modified files**. If another files are
fixed by cs tools, just revert it before commit.

## Tests

#### Behat

To launch Behat tests:

```bash
vendor/bin/behat
```

#### PHPStan

To analyse your php code, use:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse src
```
